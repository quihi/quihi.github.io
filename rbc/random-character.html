            <ul>
                <li>This does not actually include all characters, especially for RBC. Feel free to send me a list of characters that are missing and I'll add them sometime.</li>
                <li>Noteworthy Rev Arc characters may be less major and more I can remember who they are, or think they're worth including, or someone has requested fic about them. The minor character list includes nearly any name I saw mentioned a single time.</li>
                <!-- <li>Q: Why did I attempt to make a list of every character Kitszah ever mentions once? A: I didn't realize there were so many. If there's repeats, it's because I couldn't immediately tell what first and last names went together, and some last names are missing due to insufficient data to connect them with first names.</li> -->
